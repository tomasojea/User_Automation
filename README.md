## User Automation

## General info

This project automates the process of booking an appointment through the Italian consulate's online system using Selenium and Python. It interacts with the web page to navigate through the login process, fill in required form fields, and continuously search for available appointment slots at a specific time. The script handles form filling and retries to reload the calendar to check for open appointment days.

## Key features:

Uses Selenium to automate browser actions.
Logs in to the appointment system with provided credentials.
Fills in personal information in the form fields.
Continuously checks for available appointment slots and confirms the booking when one becomes available.
This automation saves time and effort by handling repetitive tasks and ensuring appointments are secured promptly.
